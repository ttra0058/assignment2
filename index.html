    <h2>CO2 emissions per capita between 1960 and 2018</h2>

      <div class="pure-u-1-5">
        <p class="smallp">In 2015 carbon dioxide (CO2) accounted for 76 percent of global total greenhouse gas emissions. By trapping
          the earth’s heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases lead to warmer temperatures, which in turn lead to the
          hallmarks of climate change: rising sea levels, more extreme weather, heat-related deaths, and the increased
          transmission of infectious diseases.</p>
          <p class="smallp">Since 1960, United States, Canada, Soviet Union (or now Russian Federation) and Australia have been
          consistenly among some of the countries with the most CO2 emissions per capita. But due to the oil production,
          few countries in the Middle East such as United Arab Emirates and Qatar took over the top of the list with
          comical amount of CO2 emission per capita.</p>
          <p class="smallp">Additionally, even though the worldwide CO2 emission per capita in the recent year is slightly lower than in
          the 70s and 80s, with a rapidly increasing world population, the amount of CO2 emissionss per year has
          increased by a significant amount which negatively affects our efforts of improving air pollution</p>

    <h2>Causes of CO2 emissions by fuel combustion</h2>
    <h4>For 20 countries with the most CO2 emisions in 2014</h4>
    <!-- pure grid group -->

      <div class="pure-u-1-5">
        <br>
        <p class="smallp">The main cause of CO2 emissions by fuel combustion in 2014 is for the production of electricity and heat with transport coming in seccond. In fact, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of worldwide electricity in 2017 ("Where does our electricity come from?," n.d.). This phenomenon is consistent for most of the examined countries with the exception of France and Brazil where large amounts of CO2 emissions are due to transportation.</p>
        <p class="smallp">This puts forward the importance of finding replacements for those main causes of CO2 emission under fuel combustion. With some alternatives such as renewable energy and environment-friendly means of transportation, we could significantly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions and inturn improve the greenhouse effect.</p>

        <p class="smallp">PM2.5, particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to

        <p class="smallp">Overall, the annual mean PM2.5 concentration were seemingly unchanged around the world with most countries in the regions of North Africa, Europe, South and Southeast Asia having slightly worse values in 2017 while already being in a terrible situation.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion">With the current problem of air pollution, which is affecting both the environmental and people's health, had not been improved over the year but rather getting worse as indicated by multiple metrics, it is crucial to find timely solutions to tackles the main causes of those issues before the point of no return.</p>
